TODO list for svndumptool
=========================

Bugs:

 * export: Ignore leading slash in repos path and check that -d works.
 * check: check that copy-from revision < current revision.
 * merge: leading slash for -x doesn't work.


Cleanup and possible bugs:
 * Cleanup temp files: Make sure a temp file is not deleted as long as it
   is still used (can multiple nodes have the same temp file?).
 * Cleanup sanitize: use a class instead of global variable option,
   better handling of temp files.


Features:

 * Add an option for setting the date of rev 0 when merging.
 * Eolfix dryrun should check EOL's.
 * Merge: make the root renamable too.
 * Check that svn:date and __rev_date are always the same.
 * Move tests from svndumptest.py into a package and add more tests...
 * Output an error if a file exists that should be opened for writing.


Ideas:

 * New command 'filter', same as svndumpfilter.
 * New command 'edit' which can do many modifications.
 * Make an abstract base class for SvnDumpFile (maybe SvnDumpReader)
   and make SvnDumpMerge, SvnDumpEolFix, SvnDumpFilter and SvnDumpEdit
   subclasses of it. Those commands can then be chained, something like:
   SvnDumpFile -> SvnDumpEolFix -> copy_dump_file()
 * Streamy versions of SvnDumpFile and SvnDumpNode.
