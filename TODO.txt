TODO list for svndumptool
=========================

 * Add an option for setting the date of rev 0 when merging.
 * Eolfix dryrun should check EOL's.
 * Merge: make the root renamable too.
 * Check that svn:date and __rev_date are always the same.
 * Move tests from svndumptest.py into a package and add more tests...
 * Output an error if a file exists that should be opened for writing.
 * Cleanup temp files.


Ideas:

 * New command 'filter', same as svndumpfilter.
 * New command 'edit' which can do many modifications.
 * Make an abstract base class for SvnDumpFile (maybe SvnDumpReader)
   and make SvnDumpMerge, SvnDumpEolFix, SvnDumpFilter and SvnDumpEdit
   subclasses of it. Those commands can then be chained, something like:
   SvnDumpFile -> SvnDumpEolFix -> copy_dump_file()
 * Streamy versions of SvnDumpFile and SvnDumpNode.
